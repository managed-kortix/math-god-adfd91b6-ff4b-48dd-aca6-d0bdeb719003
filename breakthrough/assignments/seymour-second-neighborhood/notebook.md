## 2026-07-25 — tick 1

- **Control state:** accepted exclusive ownership; status changed from `ready`
  to `running`.
- **Immediate frontier:** establish two exact neighborhood implementations and
  an exhaustive small-order differential oracle, while independent agents audit
  current structural reductions, construction families, literature, and model
  failure modes.
- **Queued falsifiable target:** determine the strongest sound constraints on a
  vertex-minimal counterexample that can be added to a direct exact model,
  emphasizing the minimum-outdegree-8 layer signature funnel.

### Exact experiment result

- Added independent Python/set and Node.js/Boolean-matrix certificate verifiers,
  strict parsers, hostile fixtures, and exhaustive ternary oriented-graph
  generation in `experiments/`.
- Commands passed:
  `python3 test_verifiers.py` and
  `python3 exhaustive_crosscheck.py --max-n 5`.
- Exact census: `1+3+27+729+59049=59809` labelled oriented graphs; both
  implementations agreed on every `N1` and `N2` set; zero counterexamples.
- **Classification:** regression/oracle validation only, explicitly not a
  finite-order solution.

### Structural compression

- Independent reports are preserved in `agents/tick1-*.md`.
- Without minimality, a degree-eight obstruction reduces to ten
  `(|B|,|A1|,r)` branches listed in `agents/tick1-literature.md`.
- Choosing a counterexample first vertex-minimal and then arc-minimal gives a
  stronger root result: `|B| in {6,7}`. Arc deletion shows every vertex deficit
  is 1 or 2 and yields exact restrictions on singleton predecessor signatures;
  see `agents/tick1-structure.md`.
- The signature projection remains feasible, so it is not a contradiction.
  This is a useful hostile failure: the next model must include witness badness
  and completion, not merely root row-degree constraints.
- Cayley orientations, their positive independent blow-ups, and complete cyclic
  substitutions cannot produce a counterexample; exact formulas are recorded
  in `agents/tick1-constructions.md`.

### Audit status and next attack

- No solution claim. No announcement permitted.
- **Next falsifiable lemma:** in the arc-minimal degree-eight case, extend the
  root predecessor signatures to exact badness constraints for `A`, beginning
  with `|B|=6`; either prove the finite signature system infeasible or emit its
  smallest exact feasible signature and identify the first missing global
  completion condition.
- **Queued implementation:** build an enumerator/CP-SAT-independent finite
  search for `(H,{P_b})` satisfying the proved root constraints, canonicalize
  under permutations of `A` and `B`, and use feasible points as adversarial
  inputs before adding any boundary multiplicity assumption.
