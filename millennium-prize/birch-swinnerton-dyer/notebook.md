Bounded scout is queued to audit the exact normalization and independently
certify the algebraic rank and the `T^2` coefficient for `389a1` at `p=5`.
No cyclotomic derivative is to be identified with a complex derivative.

## Bounded scout tick 2

For `389a1`, `a_5=-3`, so `p=5` is ordinary and has no exceptional zero.
LMFDB's `val=2` is the valuation of the 5-adic regulator, not the cyclotomic
order. Its Iwasawa data `[2,0]` means `lambda=2,mu=0`, but does not locate both
zeros at `T=0`. PARI differentiates in a weight variable with `T=6^s-1`; the
observed valuation two in the second derivative includes two factors of
`log_5(6)`. The next exact test is modular-symbol certification of zero
constant and linear cyclotomic moments, plus a replayable 2-Selmer rank upper
bound independent of analytic rank.
